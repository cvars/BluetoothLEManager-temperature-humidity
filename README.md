# BluetoothLEManager-temperature-humidity
 This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device scanning and connection using the Windows.Devices.Bluetooth API. It is designed to scan for BLE devices, connect to a selected device, and subscribe to temperature and humidity measurements.

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Manager using Windows Runtime C++/WinRT. The application scans for BLE devices, connects to a selected device, and subscribes to temperature and humidity data.

## Features
- Scans for nearby BLE devices
- Connects to a selected BLE device by index
- Subscribes to temperature and humidity data from the connected device
- Displays temperature and humidity readings in real-time

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or later
- C++/WinRT
- Bluetooth LE compatible hardware

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage
1. Run the application. It starts scanning for BLE devices automatically.
2. To connect to a device, enter the index of the device when prompted.
3. The application will display temperature and humidity data from the connected device.
